## 📌 Project Overview
**Smart Energy AI** is a next-generation energy forecasting system developed with a focus on **User Experience (UX)** and **Sustainability**. 

Unlike traditional dashboards that show complex technical voltage/amperage charts, this tool translates technical electrical parameters into **User-Friendly Questions** (e.g., "How many people are at home?", "Is the Fridge ON?"). 

It features a **Cinematic 3D Interface** with holographic visuals, making energy management engaging and accessible for non-technical users.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🔮 3D Intelligent Dashboard:** Moving deep-space backgrounds and floating glass-morphism cards.
* **🗣️ User-Friendly Inputs:** No need to know Voltage/Watts. Just enter appliance counts, and the AI calculates the load.
* **🧠 Advanced AI Engine:** Uses **XGBoost & Random Forest** for high-precision forecasting.
* **📊 Interactive 3D Analytics:** Rotatable 3D Scatter plots to visualize energy clusters.
* **🔐 Secure Admin Console:** Full user management and model retraining capabilities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit, Lottie Animations, Plotly 3D.
* **Backend:** Python, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn.
* **Database:** Local Session State (Demo) / Supabase (Production Ready).

## 🌍 Global Research Context
This project is an extension of my research at **Chengdu University of Technology, China**, where I analyzed energy consumption patterns of 2.2 Million households to build sustainable AI solutions.
